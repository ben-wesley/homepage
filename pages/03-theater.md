## past:

### *Wind-Chasing*:
#### a word-for-word recitation of Ecclesiastes

an original (mostly) one-man show

March 22, 2025 at 3pm & 7pm

St. John's Episcopal Church, Lancaster PA

conceived and performed by Benjamin Wesley

co-produced by Joanna Becker

featuring choreography by Alysha Argot

In my first self-produced show, I licensed the Common English Bible translation of Ecclesiastes to perform as a circus-themed one-man show, titled Wind-Chasing. An ancient work of "wisdom literature," Ecclesiastes contrasts wisdom and foolishness, but it can also be very critical of "wisdom" itself and cynical towards the world and God. To emphasize these themes, I dressed up as a jester being exhibited as a sideshow: THE WISEST MAN IN THE WORLD.
